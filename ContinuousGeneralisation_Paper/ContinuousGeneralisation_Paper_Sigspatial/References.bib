  Abstract                 = {In on-demand map generation, a base-map is modified to meet user requirements on scale, resolution, and other parameters. Since there are many ways of satisfying the requirement, we need a method of measuring the quality of the alternative maps. In this paper, we introduce a uniform framework for measuring the quality of generalized maps. The proposed Map Quality measure takes into account changes in all local objects (Shape Similarity), their neighborhoods (Location Similarity) and lastly across the entire map (Semantic Content Similarity). These three quality aspects measure the major generalization operators of simplification, relocation and selection, exaggeration and aggregation, collapse and typification. The three different aspects are combined using user-specified weights. Thus, the proposed framework supports the automatic choice of best alternative map according to preferences of the user or application.},

  Abstract                 = {We present an optimization approach to simplify sets of building footprints represented as polygons. We simplify each polygonal ring by selecting a subsequence of its original edges; the vertices of the simplified ring are defined by intersections of consecutive (and possibly extended) edges in the selected sequence. Our aim is to minimize the number of all output edges subject to a user-defined error tolerance. Since we earlier showed that the problem is NP-hard when requiring non-intersecting simple polygons as output, we cannot hope for an efficient, exact algorithm. Therefore, we present an efficient algorithm for a relaxed problem and an integer program (IP) that allows us to solve the original problem with existing software. Our IP is large, since it has $O(m^6)$ constraints, where $m$ is the number of input edges. In order to keep the running time small, we first consider a subset of only $O(m)$ constraints. The choice of the constraints ensures some basic properties of the solution. Constraints that were neglected are added during optimization whenever they become violated by a new solution encountered. Using this approach we simplified a set of 144 buildings with a total of 2056 edges in 4.1 seconds on a standard desktop PC; the simplified building set contained 762 edges. During optimization, the number of constraints increased by a mere 13 %. We also show how to apply cartographic quality measures in our method and discuss their effects on examples.},

  Abstract                 = {Human perception of shape is based on visual parts of objects to a point that a single, significant visual part is sufficient to recognize the whole object. For example, if you see a hand in the door, you expect a human behind the door. Therefore, a cognitively motivated shape similarity measure for recognition applications should be based on visual parts. This cognitive assumption leads to two related problems of scale selection and subpart selection. To find a given query part Q as part of an object C, Q needs to have a correct size with regards to C (scale selection). Assuming that the correct size is selected, the part Q must be compared to all possible subparts of C (subpart selection). For global, contour-based similarity measures, scaling the whole contour curves of both objects to the same length usually solves the problem of scale selection. Although this is not an optimal solution, it works if the whole contour curves are `sufficiently' similar. Subpart selection problem does not occur in the implementation of global similarity measures.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a new method for use in performing continuous scale transformations of linear features using Simulated Annealing-Based Morphing (SABM). This study addresses two key problems in the continuous generalization of linear features by morphing, specifically the detection of characteristic points and correspondence matching. First, an algorithm that performs robust detection of characteristic points is developed that is based on the Constrained Delaunay Triangulation (CDT) model. Then, an optimal problem is defined and solved to associate the characteristic points between a coarser representation and a finer representation. The algorithm decomposes the input shapes into several pairs of corresponding segments and uses the simulated annealing algorithm to find the optimal matching. Simple straight-line trajectories are used to define the movements between corresponding points. The experimental results show that the SABM method can be used for continuous generalization and generates smooth, natural and visually pleasing linear features with gradient effects. In contrast to linear interpolation, the SABM method uses the simulated annealing technique to optimize the correspondence between characteristic points. Moreover, it avoids interior distortions within intermediate shapes and preserves the geographical characteristics of the input shapes.},

  Abstract                 = {We study the problem of morphing two polygons of building footprints at two different scales. This problem frequently occurs during the continuous zooming of interactive maps. The ground plan of a building footprint on a map has orthogonal characteristics, but traditional morphing methods cannot preserve these geographic characteristics at intermediate scales. We attempt to address this issue by presenting a turning angle function-based morphing model (TAFBM) that can generate polygons at an intermediate scale with an identical turning angle for each side. Thus, the orthogonal characteristics can be preserved during the entire interpolation. A case study demonstrates that the model yields good results when applied to data from a building map at various scales. During the continuous generalization, the orthogonal characteristics and their relationships with the spatial direction and topology are well preserved.},

  Abstract                 = {Geographic shape compactness is of concern in such contexts as urban morphology, political districting, and accuracy of enumeration unit values. The purpose of the present paper is to compare, categorize, and evaluate the various methods suggested for measuring compactness. Review of suggested compactness indices resulted in the identification of four categories, based upon: 1) perimeter-area measurement, 2) single parameters of related circles, 3) direct comparison to a standard shape, and 4) dispersion of elements of a shape's area. In all, eleven indices were calculated for a sample of U.S. counties and their frequency distributions were compared. Additionally, similarities and differences in the units of high, median, and low compactness were identified. Within each category, indices exhibited considerable similarity while significant differences were evident from category to category. These differences suggested variation in accuracy with which the indices measure compactness. It was hypothesized that measures based upon dispersion of elements of a shape's area would provide the most accurate measure because they consider the shape as a whole while the other indices do not. Determination of the accuracy with which each index measures compactness supported this hypothesis. Indices based upon direct comparison to a standard shape were found to be of similar accuracy and, therefore, also judged to be suitable compactness measures. Those measures based upon perimeter-area measurement and single parameters of related circles were determined to be considerably less accurate measures of compactness.},

  Abstract                 = {Fire is a natural component of many terrestrial ecosystems; however, uncontrolled intense wildfires can cause loss of human life and destruction of natural resources. Prescribed burning is a management activity undertaken for the purposes of both wildfire hazard reduction and the preservation of fire-adapted ecosystems. Achievement of prescribed burn targets is made difficult by operational constraints such as limited personnel, equipment and suitable weather for undertaking burning. Prescribed burn program implementation may benefit from efficiencies gained in undertaking larger burns. Here, we present a mixed-integer programming formulation for aggregation of prescribed burn units. The model minimizes the total prescribed burn perimeter requiring management, by aggregating existing `fundamental' burn units into larger compact and contiguous units or `clusters'. This problem is a special case of the `supervised regionalization' or the ` {\$}{\$}p{\$}{\$} p -regions problem'. The model's functionality is demonstrated on a test landscape and a number of extensions and implementation issues are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Cartographic generalization aims to represent geographical information on a map whose specifications are different from those of the original database. Generalization often implies scale reduction, which generates legibility problems. To be readable at smaller scale, geographical objects often need to be enlarged, which generates problems of overlapping features or map congestion. To manage this problem with respect to buildings, we present a method of selection based on the typification principle that creates a result with fewer objects, but preserves the initial pattern of distribution. For this we use a graph of proximity on the building set, which is analysed and segmented with respect to various criteria, taken from gestalt theory. This analysis provides geographical information that is attached to each group of buildings such as the mean size of buildings, shape of the group, and density. This information is independent of scale. The information from the analysis stage is used to define methods to represent them at the target scale. The aim is to preserve the pattern as far as possible, preserve similarities and differences between the groups with regard to density, size and orientation of buildings. We present some results that have been obtained using the platform Strat{\`e}ge, developed in the COGIT laboratory at the Institut G{\'e}ographique National, Paris. },

  Abstract                 = {Visualizing spatial information on small mobile displays is a big chance and challenge at the same time. In order to address the tradeoff between huge spatial data sets and small storage capacities and visualization screens, we propose to visualize only the information on the screen which adequately fits the current resolution. To realize this, we automatically decompose the generalization of an object into a sequence of elementary steps. From this, one can later easily obtain any desired generalization level by applying the appropriate subpart of the sequence. The method method does not only lead to smooth transitions between different object representations but also is useful for incremental transmission of maps through limited bandwidth channels.},
