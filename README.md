Note: Please put our program, ContinuousGeneralizer, under the path “C:\MyWork\DailyWork\ContinuousGeneralisation”. We insist on the path because we may use some absolute paths in the program. If ContinuousGeneralizer is put somewhere else, errors may occur. See ReadMe.docx in folder ContinuousGeneralizer for more details.
