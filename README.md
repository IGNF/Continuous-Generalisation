# ContinuousGeneralisation
This is a project for continuous map generalization.

The program (software) is in folder 'ContinuousGeneralizer'.
The main langulage is C#. Languages C++ and Visual Basic .NET are also used in this program. However, it is fine if you do not have experience in C++ and Visual Basic .NET.
In order to run this program you must install Microsoft Visual Studio 2015, ArcObjects SDK 10.4.1, and Microsoft Office 2016.

Please put the program, ContinuousGeneralizer, under the path 'C:\MyWork\DailyWork\ContinuousGeneralisation'. We insist on the path because we use some absolute paths in the program. If ContinuousGeneralizer is put somewhere else, errors may occur. See ReadMe.docx in folder ContinuousGeneralizer for more details.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
