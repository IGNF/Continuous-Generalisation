  Abstract                 = {We present an optimization approach to simplify sets of building footprints represented as polygons. We simplify each polygonal ring by selecting a subsequence of its original edges; the vertices of the simplified ring are defined by intersections of consecutive (and possibly extended) edges in the selected sequence. Our aim is to minimize the number of all output edges subject to a user-defined error tolerance. Since we earlier showed that the problem is NP-hard when requiring non-intersecting simple polygons as output, we cannot hope for an efficient, exact algorithm. Therefore, we present an efficient algorithm for a relaxed problem and an integer program (IP) that allows us to solve the original problem with existing software. Our IP is large, since it has $O(m^6)$ constraints, where $m$ is the number of input edges. In order to keep the running time small, we first consider a subset of only $O(m)$ constraints. The choice of the constraints ensures some basic properties of the solution. Constraints that were neglected are added during optimization whenever they become violated by a new solution encountered. Using this approach we simplified a set of 144 buildings with a total of 2056 edges in 4.1 seconds on a standard desktop PC; the simplified building set contained 762 edges. During optimization, the number of constraints increased by a mere 13 %. We also show how to apply cartographic quality measures in our method and discuss their effects on examples.},

  Abstract                 = {Cartographic generalization aims to represent geographical information on a map whose specifications are different from those of the original database. Generalization often implies scale reduction, which generates legibility problems. To be readable at smaller scale, geographical objects often need to be enlarged, which generates problems of overlapping features or map congestion. To manage this problem with respect to buildings, we present a method of selection based on the typification principle that creates a result with fewer objects, but preserves the initial pattern of distribution. For this we use a graph of proximity on the building set, which is analysed and segmented with respect to various criteria, taken from gestalt theory. This analysis provides geographical information that is attached to each group of buildings such as the mean size of buildings, shape of the group, and density. This information is independent of scale. The information from the analysis stage is used to define methods to represent them at the target scale. The aim is to preserve the pattern as far as possible, preserve similarities and differences between the groups with regard to density, size and orientation of buildings. We present some results that have been obtained using the platform Strat{\`e}ge, developed in the COGIT laboratory at the Institut G{\'e}ographique National, Paris. },

  Abstract                 = {Visualizing spatial information on small mobile displays is a big chance and challenge at the same time. In order to address the tradeoff between huge spatial data sets and small storage capacities and visualization screens, we propose to visualize only the information on the screen which adequately fits the current resolution. To realize this, we automatically decompose the generalization of an object into a sequence of elementary steps. From this, one can later easily obtain any desired generalization level by applying the appropriate subpart of the sequence. The method method does not only lead to smooth transitions between different object representations but also is useful for incremental transmission of maps through limited bandwidth channels.},
